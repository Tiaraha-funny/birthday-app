### **Structure**
In this project, I created a birthday application with pure vanilla Javascript. This app shows us whose person is the closest to have their birthday. These are the steps that I did:
- Fetch all the people's birthday if localstorage is empty.
- Display sorted list of people.
- Handle the two buttons edit and delete (forms in a modal).
- Use local storage to store edited lists in the browser.
### **Something I learned**
- Manipulating DOM with JS
- Dynamically filtering list of people by name and date of birth at the same time
- Edit and save existing person details.
- Add new people
- Sort list by upcoming birthday
- Using local storage to make changes persistent between browser sessions
## **Built With**
- Vanilla Javascript, CSS, HTML - no frameworks
