# Term 3 JS Project : Birthday App

## Structure
In this project, I creat a birthday list. The app will show us whose person is the closest to have their birthday. These are the steps that I did: 
    
1- I create a fetch function to fetch all the people in people.js file by using an async function.

2- I display it in one function to set it in an html and push the list of people in that html

3- I create an add function to handle the adding lists so that the users can add the list of people's birthday.

4- To handle the two buttons edit and delete, I create two functions within html each followed by form in a modal. So when you click the button the form will appear and you can do whatever you do.

5- The destroy function is to handle the break when the needs is done or finish.

6- I have local storage function to save all the lists in the browser

## Need to improve

I have a lot to improve from this project:

 - access the npm of date
- use the bootstrap style
- delete and edit the added person from the users
- import and export file without errors

## Something to learn

- I learned how to count date in a function

## Most challenge
The most challege that I faced and not solve till now is 
- delete and edit the added person from the users
- Making the refuctor. I struggle to get the result variable works properly. It throws an error that needs to use let instead of const but it didn't change when I changed it.

## More explaination
I need more explanaition on how to import and export variable inside a function.

## Other comments

I have got an error that is not solved: **uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Assignment to constant variable at restoreFromLocalStorage"**.

I have to change cost variable into let. I triedto do that but it didn't.

 If I couldn't solve this bug it is hard to get the others work properly.
